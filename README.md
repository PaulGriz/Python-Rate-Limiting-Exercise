#### More on Redis Below:
> Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, 
> cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, 
> sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. 
> Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of 
> on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning w
